Each Java process has a pid, which you first need to find with the jps command.

Once you have the pid, you can use jstat -gc [insert-pid-here] to find statistics of the behavior of the garbage collected heap.

jstat -gccapacity [insert-pid-here] will present information about memory pool generation and space capabilities.

jstat -gcutil [insert-pid-here] will present the utilization of each generation as a percentage of its capacity. Useful to get an at a glance view of usage.

# Thread Dump Java Process

To get a thread dump of a Java process, follow these steps:
Identify the process ID (PID) of the Java process using the following command:

$ jps
This command will list all the Java processes running on the system along with their process IDs.

Once you have identified the PID of the Java process, use the following command to generate a thread dump:

$ jstack <pid> > <filename>.txt
Replace <pid> with the process ID of the Java process and <filename> with the name of the file you want to save the thread dump in. For example:

$ jstack 1234 > thread-dump.txt
The above command will create a thread dump in the specified file. Open the file in a text editor to view the thread dump.

Alternatively, you can also use tools like jvisualvm, jconsole, or Java Mission Control to generate and view thread dumps of a Java process.
