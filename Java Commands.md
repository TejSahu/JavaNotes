# Thread Dump Java Process

To get a thread dump of a Java process, follow these steps:
Identify the process ID (PID) of the Java process using the following command:

$ jps
This command will list all the Java processes running on the system along with their process IDs.

Once you have identified the PID of the Java process, use the following command to generate a thread dump:

$ jstack <pid> > <filename>.txt
Replace <pid> with the process ID of the Java process and <filename> with the name of the file you want to save the thread dump in. For example:

$ jstack 1234 > thread-dump.txt
The above command will create a thread dump in the specified file. Open the file in a text editor to view the thread dump.

Alternatively, you can also use tools like jvisualvm, jconsole, or Java Mission Control to generate and view thread dumps of a Java process.


# Interpreting GC logs

Reading and analyzing a Java process's GC log is an important skill for diagnosing memory-related issues in a Java application. Here are the basic steps to read and analyze a GC log:

Enable GC logging: To enable GC logging, add the following flags to the command-line options when starting the Java process:


-verbose:gc -Xloggc:<filename>
This will enable verbose GC logging and write the log output to the specified file.

Obtain the GC log file: Once the Java process is running, you can obtain the GC log file either by specifying an absolute path for the -Xloggc option or by using the jcmd utility to dump the log to a file:


jcmd <pid> GC.log
where <pid> is the process ID of the Java process.

Analyze the GC log file: There are several tools that can be used to analyze the GC log file, including:

GCViewer: A free tool that provides a visual representation of the GC log data, including graphs and statistics.
GCToolkit: An open-source tool that provides a comprehensive set of GC log analysis features, including leak detection and heap analysis.
HPjmeter: A tool that provides detailed analysis of GC logs, including object allocation and garbage collection behavior.
Once you have chosen a tool, load the GC log file and analyze the data to identify potential memory leaks, excessive garbage collection, or other performance issues.

Take action: Once you have identified issues in the GC log, take action to resolve them. This may involve optimizing object allocation, tuning the garbage collector, or modifying the application code to reduce memory usage.

# jcmd commands for heap dump or histogram

Create a heap dump

The preferred way to create a heap dump is

jcmd <pid> GC.heap_dump filename=Myheapdump

Create a heap histogram

The preferred way to create a heap histogram is

jcmd <pid> GC.class_histogram filename=Myheaphistogram

jmap -dump:live,format=b,file=heap.bin pid

-clstats pid
Connects to a running process and prints class loader statistics of Java heap.
-finalizerinfo pid
Connects to a running process and prints information on objects awaiting finalization.
-histo[:live] pid
Connects to a running process and prints a histogram of the Java object heap. If the live suboption is specified, it then counts only live objects.
